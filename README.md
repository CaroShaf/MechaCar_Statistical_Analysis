## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Summary Statistics from Linear Model of MPG Prediction of MechaCar Prototypes  [https://github.com/CaroShaf/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/MechaCarSummaryStats.png]

From this screen shot of our RStudio/RScript analysis, we can see that our linear regression model gives the r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that roughly 72% of all MPG
predictions will be correct when using this linear model. In addition, the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed
significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
